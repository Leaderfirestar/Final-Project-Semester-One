# Final-Project-Semester-One
Read the Title
The Purpose of the website I made is to replace the current website files that my high school robotics club uses. Their site was non-responisve, and I wanted to give it a new look.
The index page serves as a introduction to our team, as well as a launch pad to more information.
The About page is about the challenge presented to our team this year.
The Our Team page talks specifically about our team, who's involved, and how to get involved.
The Game Page has my cmst 103 p5 project on there. It's asteroids, minus any sort of collision.
The Sponsors page is to allow for the future addition of a list of sponsors we have, as well as a link to the Contact page to allow more people to sponsor.
The Contact page is for questions, comments, concerns, and sponsors to contact us.
A couple of features on this site are the use of iframes to display a youtube video, hyperlinks that change color after you've used them, a mailto hyperlink, and a call hyperlink to make getting in touch easier for the viewer. I also made use of the table features in html5 to allow for a better understanding of scoring that the video did not cover.
Some design decisions I made include the index page. I couldn't initially get the iframe and the logo to sit next to each other, so i made a rows and collomns div to better seperate them. The only other noticeable thing was making comments required on the contact page. I did this simply so that a viewer would give a brief description of what they wanted, and then on the server side, it could be forwarded to the person who could best help them.
The first problem I encountered was the home page video/logo problem I mentioned above. The next problem was embedding the p5 script onto the page and having it fit. The final major problem I had was getting the logo on the index page to display corretly when it shrank down to that size. At some points in development, it displayed above the nav bar, to the far right, basically everywhere but where I needed it.
I'm not really sure how to express what all I learned... I have a significant;y better understanding of the fundementals behind html now, and while I don't think I have my skills up to a marketable level, I think they're well on their way.
